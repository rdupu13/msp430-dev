# General Development Process 

- Do your initial planning activities in a `planning` branch.
    - Plan out your software architecture.
    - Complete the workload distribution form.
    - Write pseudocode or create flowcharts for the main components.
    - Create a preliminary circuit diagram.
- Once your initial planning is done, create a pull request for the `planning` branch.
- For each module or feature (e.g., keypad, RGB LED, pwm, LCD, etc.):
    - Create a new branch.
    - Do any initial planning (e.g., pseudocode, flowcharts, diagrams) that wasn't done earlier. Do this and commit this before writing code.
    - Implement and test the module. Use separate test files to test the module (i.e., don't test everything in the main app; using separate test files lets you easily re-run tests to verify nothing broke or the module still works).
    - Create a pull request. The pull request must include evidence of your module working (e.g., screenshots from the AD2 showing that your code works, or some other form of validation).
    - Have your team member perform a code review.
    - Once your team member has approved the pull request, merge it into `main`.


We're following a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
The git history will look something like this:

```mermaid
gitGraph:
    commit
    branch planning
    switch planning
    commit
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge planning
    branch pwm
    switch pwm
    branch keypad
    switch keypad
    commit
    commit
    switch pwm
    commit
    commit
    commit
    switch keypad
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge keypad
    switch pwm
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge pwm
    branch rgb
    switch rgb
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge rgb
    branch integration
    switch integration
    commit
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge integration
    branch final-docs
    switch final-docs
    commit
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge final-docs
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No development should happen in the `main` branch. Everything should be done in a separate branch and be review/approved by the team via pull requests. When you're working together on integration, this should still be done in a separate branch.

> [!TIP]
> Remember to use `--set-upstream origin <branch-name>` when pushing your new branch for the first time.
> ```
> git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
> ```


## Summary of commands and workflow

In general, you will do the following:
```bash
# create a new branch and switch to it
git switch -c pwm

# do some work, then add, commit, and push
git add filename.c
git commit

# the first time you push a new branch, you have to use --set-upstream
git push --set-upstream origin pwm

# do some more work
git add filename.c
git commit
git push

# do a pull request on GitHub, then switch to main and pull
# the changes down to your local repository
git switch main
git pull

# make a new branch for a new feature, and repeat the process
git switch -c keypad
git add keypad.c
git commit
git push --set-upstream origin keypad
git add keypad.c
git commit
git push
```

## Checking out an upstream branch

When a branch has been created by your partner and is on GitHub, but you don't have it locally, you use `git switch` to checkout the branch. For example, if your partner pushed a `pwm` branch to GitHub, you would check it out with
```bash
git switch pwm
```
If you haven't synced with GitHub recently, you may need to fetch the new branch
```bash
git fetch # git pull would also work, since pull is just fetch plus merge
```

## Seeing what branches exist

To see what branches you have locally, run `git branch`.

To see what branches exist both locally and on GitHub, run `git branch -a`.


# Git Resources

Please refer to any of the git resources I've put on Canvas or linked in the [intro to git presentation](https://msu-eele-465.github.io/intro-to-git/). There are so many git resources, tutorials, and videos out there; I'm sure you'll find something that helps and makes sense for you.
